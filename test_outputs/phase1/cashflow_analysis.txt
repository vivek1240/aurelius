Instruction: 
Dive into a comprehensive evaluation of the company's cash flow for the latest fiscal year, focusing on cash inflows 
and outflows across operating, investing, and financing activities. Examine the operational cash flow to assess the 
core business profitability, scrutinize investing activities for insights into capital expenditures and investments, 
and review financing activities to understand debt, equity movements, and dividend policies. Compare these cash movements 
to prior periods to discern trends, sustainability, and liquidity risks. Conclude with an informed analysis of the company's 
cash management effectiveness, liquidity position, and potential for future growth or financial challenges in a single paragraph.
